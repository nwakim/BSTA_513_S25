The make-up assignment will be due one week after the in-class discussion day. To turn in the assignment, you can email your document to Nicky. 

## Directions

In a half page to one page, please answer the following questions about your peer's (or peers') lab assignment:

- What was their research question?
- What were three differences in your approach to the lab?
- What did you learn from their work?
- What would you improve from your own lab?
