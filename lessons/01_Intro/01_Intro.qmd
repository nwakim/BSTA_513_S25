# Still me!

## Check the Echo360 link

-   Let's check the link and make sure we can see everything!

## Course Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students should be able to...

1.  Apply and interpret some hypothesis-testing procedures for two-way and three-way **contingency tables**

2.  Compute and **interpret measures of association** for **binary and ordinal data**.

3.  Calculate and correctly interpret **odds ratios using logistic regression**, make comparison across groups and examine relationship between binary outcome and predictor variables.

4.  Apply appropriate **model-building strategies for logistic regression**. Effectively use statistical computing packages for contingency table and logistic regression procedures.

5.  Perform **Poisson regression** analysis using count data and interpret model estimates, make comparison across groups and examine relationship between outcome and predictor variables.

6.  Coherently **summarize methods and results of data analyses**, and discuss in context of original health-related research questions to audiences with varied statistical background.

## New way to record/view lectures

-   I will be using Echo360 to automatically record time from 1-3pm in this room!

-   It will be LIVE

    -   So you can watch in real time, but won't be able to interact with us

    -   Might have a 10 second lag

    -   No need to tell me if you cannot make class

-   [Here is the link to the Echo site!](echo360.org) I'll keep posting it on the weekly pages

    -   Currently a public link, but working on getting everyone an account so we can make it private

-   I don't have to post anything after class, so no issues with me forgetting to post it

## New Exit ticket style

-   All the questions are optional

-   But still open the link and submit!

-   4 of the exit tickets are dropped!

## Some important tasks

-   Star the class website: <https://nwakim.github.io/S25_BSTA_513/>

-   Complete the [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/?29781152-juu4v) for office hours

    -   If your calendar feels set, take 5 minutes to fill this out now!

    -   Complete by Thursday at 11pm!!!

-   Highly suggest that you make an appointment with a learning specialist through [Student Academic Support Services](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/portal/site/Student_Support)!

## Syllabus

-   Not many changes from last quarters syllabus
-   Let's look at the schedule!

## Assessment Breakdown

-   We will have quizzes and required in-person lab discussions (on schedule)
-   Getting rid of midterm feedback - felt exhaustive

|  |  |  |  |  |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| **Course activity** | **Type of Assessment** | **Due Date** | **Percentage of final grade (BSTA 513)** | **Percentage of final grade (BSTA 613)** |
| Homework | Formative | Every 1-2 weeks | 30% | 25% |
| **Quizzes** | **Summative** | **4/27, 5/18, 6/1** | **25%** | **25%** |
| Project Labs | Formative/Summative | Every 2-3 weeks | 25% | 25% |
| **Lab Discussion + Poster Day Participation** | **N/A** | **Every 2-3 weeks** | **5%** | **5%** |
| Project Poster | Summative | 6/13 | 10% | 10% |
| Exit tickets (Attendance) | N/A | Twice Weekly | 5% | 5% |
| 613 Readings | Formative | Approx. every other week | 0% | 5% |

## Quizzes

-   Last quarter, I removed the quizzes that I implemented in W24

-   I noticed there were some key learning objectives that many of us were not meeting in the project

    -   Not your fault

-   Leading me to implement some new assessment practices

-   I think quizzes are a helpful way to embed a checkpoint for understanding

-   Quizzes will NOT be in class

    -   Quizzes will open at 3pm on Wednesday and close at 11pm on Sunday

    -   I'm open to changing the exact timing of this

## Lab Discussion + Poster Day Participation

-   We will have 5 classes with required in-person attendance

    -   4 lab discussion days

    -   1 poster day

-   Lab discussions will either take the full or half class time

    -   They will always follow the due date for a lab

-   You will spend the time in a pair or group to discuss what you did in your lab

# Any questions on how this quarter is going to go?

## How to print slides

-   Anyone have issues with this?

    -   I can show how to do it in Chrome and Safari

-   [Instructions on Quarto page](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf)
