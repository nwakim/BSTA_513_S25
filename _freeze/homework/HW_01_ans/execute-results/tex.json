I would like you to make a flow chart for the different tests we learned in Classes 1 and 2. You’ll need to include characteristics for:\n\n-   Number of variables (1, 2, or 3 - we will go over 3 variables in Class 4)\n-   Number of categories in each variable\n-   Sample size is small\n-   Ordinal/nominal independent variable\n-   Ordinal/nominal response variable(s)\n\nFor example, if I make a decision tree that includes end nodes for different animals (cat, dog, snake, turtle, and hawk) using yes/no characteristics (has a shell, woof/meows, has fur, or flies), then my flow chart would look like: [See my example under Sakai Resources.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/access/content/group/BSTA-513-1-AX-Sp23/Homework_1/Diagram.png) You are welcome to draw this chart. I used SmartArt under the Insert tab in Word to create mine.\n",
