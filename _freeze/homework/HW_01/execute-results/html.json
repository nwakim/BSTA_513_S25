Make sure to follow the entire test process demonstrated in the slides.\n\n### Question 5\nA study looked at the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) use on heart disease in women 40 to 44 years of age. The researchers prospectively tracked whether or not the women developed a myocardial infarction (MI) over a 3-year period. The table below summarizes their results with columns indicating whether or not women developed MI and rows indicating their OC use. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Yes </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> No </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> OC users </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4987 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Non-OC users </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9993 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Part a\nCompute the estimated risk difference comparing OC users to non-OC users. Include a 95% CI for the estimate and interpretation of the estimated value. \n\n\n#### Part b\nCompute the estimated relative risk comparing OC users to non-OC users.

Include a 95% CI for the estimate and interpretation of the estimated value. \n\n#### Part d\nIs the OR a good approximation of the RR? Explain why or why not. \n\n### Question 6\nOne important aspect of medical diagnosis is its reproducibility. Suppose that two different doctors examine 100 patients for dyspnea in a respiratory-disease clinic, and that doctor A diagnosed 15 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor B did not), doctor B diagnosed 10 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor A did not), and both doctor A and doctor B diagnosed 7 patients as having dyspnea. \n\n#### Part a\nConstruct a two-way contingency table to summarize the dyspnea diagnoses from doctor A and B.\n\n#### Part b\nCompute the Cohen's kappa, 95% confidence interval, and interpret the results. What level of agreement does your kappa indicate?\n\n## Questions Part 2\n\nThe following questions are intended to give you **practice in connecting concepts** that will help you make decisions in real world applications. \n\n### Question 7\nStart making a comprehensive table or outline for the inference tests that we have covered. Here is a list of the tests we have covered:\n\n* Single proportion\n* Chi-squared test for general association\n* Fisher's Exact test for general association\n* Cochran-Armitage test for trend\n* Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend\n\nAnd here is a list of attributes to include:\n\n* Number of variables testing\n* Types of variables\n* Criteria (if any)\n* Hypothesis test\n* Test statistic (if we went over it)\n* R code for test\n* Sample size / Power calculation (**optional**, not discussed in class)\n* Special notes (**optional**)\n\nFor example, I could make a table with different rows corresponding to different tests and different columns for each attribute.\n\n\n### Question 8\n\nI want you to gain experience exploring a package and function. This is an important skill in coding that can help you grow as an applied statistician. \n\nIn your previous course, the function lm() was introduced to perform linear regression. In this class, we will heavily use the function glm(). By typing \"?glm\" in the R console, we can open the Help page for glm(). The following questions ask about the glm() function. You can Google or use [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/glm) to answer the questions. \n\nFeel free to [read more](https://www.statology.org/glm-vs-lm-in-r/) about the differences between lm() and glm().\n\n#### Part a\n\nWhat does the input \"family\" mean? If I wanted to perform regression using a Poisson distribution, what would I input into family?\n\n#### Part b\nWhat is the default action for the \"na.action\" input?\n\n#### Part c\nHow does the glm() function fit our model? (Hint: see \"method\")\n\n#### Part d\nDo you think the output of summary() will be the same for lm() and glm()?\n\n### Question 9\nThis question is meant to emphasize the differences between linear regression and logistic regression. Each part will ask about different aspects of the two regression models. If the question has multiple choice answers, then you must write 1-2 sentences justifying your answer.\n\n\n#### Part a\nIn **linear** regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\na. binary\nb. continuous\nc. count\nd. ordinal\n\n\n#### Part b\nIn **logistic** regression, what type of variable is our response/outcome variable?\n\na. binary\nb. continuous\nc. count\nd. normal\n\n\n#### Part c\nWhat assumptions in linear regression? Please state the assumption name and characteristics of that assumption.\n\n#### Part d\n\nWhich assumptions of linear regression are violated if we try to fit a binary response using linear regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Independence\nb. Linearity\nc. Normality\nd. Homoscedasticity\n\n\n#### Part e\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What is the random component used in linear regression? What is the random component used in logistic regression? Name the specific variable type and distribution for it.\n\n#### Part f\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What link function do we use in linear regression? What link function do we use in logistic regression? Name the link and write out the function.\n\n\n#### Part g\nPlease use our notes on generalized linear models (GLMs) to answer this question. What is the systematic component used in simple linear regression? What is the systematic component used in simple logistic regression? Please write out the function for the systematic component for a single covariate. \n\n\n#### Part h\nHow do we determine our coefficient estimates (estimates of the parameter values) in linear regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Ordinary least squares\nb. Maximum likelihood estimation\n\n\n#### Part i\nHow do we determine our coefficient estimates (estimates of the parameter values) in logistic regression? You may choose more than one answer.\n\na. Ordinary least squares\nb. Maximum likelihood estimation\n\n\n### Question 10\n\n**OPTIONAL**\n\nLetâ€™s make a decision tree on the different tests we learned! I would like you to make a flow chart for the different tests we learned in Classes 1 and 2. Youâ€™ll need to include characteristics for:\n\n*\tNumber of variables (1, 2, or 3 - we will go over 3 variables in Class 4)\n*\tNumber of categories in each variable \n*\tSample size is small\n*\tOrdinal/nominal independent variable\n*\tOrdinal/nominal response variable(s)\n\nFor example, if I make a decision tree that includes end nodes for different animals (cat, dog, snake, turtle, and hawk) using yes/no characteristics (has a shell, woof/meows, has fur, or flies), then my flow chart would look like: [See my example under Sakai Resources.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/access/content/group/BSTA-513-1-AX-Sp23/Homework_1/Diagram.png) You are welcome to draw this chart. I used SmartArt under the Insert tab in Word to create mine.\n\n",
