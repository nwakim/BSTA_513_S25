### Question 5

A study looked at the effects of oral contraceptive (OC) use on heart disease in women 40 to 44 years of age. The researchers prospectively tracked whether or not the women developed a myocardial infarction (MI) over a 3-year period. The table below summarizes their results with columns indicating whether or not women developed MI and rows indicating their OC use.

```{r echo=FALSE}
t1 <- matrix(c(13,4987,7,9993),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(t1) <- c("Yes","No")
rownames(t1) <- c("OC users","Non-OC users")
# t1 <- as.table(t1)
# kable(t1) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
t1 %>% kable(table.attr = 'data-quarto-disable-processing="true"') %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

One important aspect of medical diagnosis is its reproducibility. Suppose that two different doctors examine 100 patients for dyspnea in a respiratory-disease clinic, and that doctor A diagnosed 15 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor B did not), doctor B diagnosed 10 patients as having dyspnea (while doctor A did not), and both doctor A and doctor B diagnosed 7 patients as having dyspnea.

Not given
:::

## Questions Part 2

The following questions are intended to give you **practice in connecting concepts** that will help you make decisions in real world applications.

### Question 7

Start making a comprehensive table or outline for the inference tests that we have covered. Here is a list of the tests we have covered:

-   Single proportion
-   Chi-squared test for general association
-   Fisher's Exact test for general association
-   Cochran-Armitage test for trend
-   Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend

And here is a list of attributes to include:

-   Number of variables testing
-   Types of variables
-   Criteria (if any)
-   Hypothesis test
-   R code for test
-   Sample size / Power calculation (**optional**, not discussed in class)
-   Special notes (**optional**)

For example, I could make a table with different rows corresponding to different tests and different columns for each attribute.

::: blue

|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Single proportion | 1 | Nominal, binary | None | $H_0: \widehat{p}=p, H_1: \widehat{p} \neq p$ | `prop.test()` |
| Chi-squared test for general association |  |  |  |  |  |
| Fisher's Exact test for general association |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cochran-Armitage test for trend |  |  |  |  |  |
| Mantel-Haenszel test for linear trend |  |  |  |  |  |

### Question 8

I want you to gain experience exploring a package and function. This is an important skill in coding that can help you grow as an applied statistician.

In your previous course, the function lm() was introduced to perform linear regression. In this class, we will heavily use the function glm(). By typing "?glm" in the R console, we can open the Help page for glm(). The following questions ask about the glm() function. You can Google or use [R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/glm) to answer the questions.

Feel free to [read more](https://www.statology.org/glm-vs-lm-in-r/) about the differences between lm() and glm().

#### Part a

What does the input "family" mean? If I wanted to perform regression using a Poisson distribution, what would I input into family?

::: blue
Not given
:::

#### Part b

What is the default action for the "na.action" input?

::: blue
Not given
:::

#### Part c

How does the glm() function fit our model? (Hint: see "method")

::: blue
Not given
:::

#### Part d

Do you think the output of summary() will be the same for lm() and glm()?

::: blue
Not given
:::

### Question 10

**OPTIONAL**

Let’s make a decision tree on the different tests we learned! I would like you to make a flow chart for the different tests we learned in Classes 1 and 2. You’ll need to include characteristics for:

-   Number of variables (1, 2, or 3 - we will go over 3 variables in Class 4)
-   Number of categories in each variable
-   Sample size is small
-   Ordinal/nominal independent variable
-   Ordinal/nominal response variable(s)

For example, if I make a decision tree that includes end nodes for different animals (cat, dog, snake, turtle, and hawk) using yes/no characteristics (has a shell, woof/meows, has fur, or flies), then my flow chart would look like: [See my example under Sakai Resources.](https://sakai.ohsu.edu/access/content/group/BSTA-513-1-AX-Sp23/Homework_1/Diagram.png) You are welcome to draw this chart. I used SmartArt under the Insert tab in Word to create mine.
